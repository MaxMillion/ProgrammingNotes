SQL Notes


select<column list>
from<table>
where<criteria>
order by<column list>


"nulls last" can be used after order by clause
removing a comma between columns makes an alias
optional keyword "as" when making aliases
can use double quotes to force case/allow spaces on aliases
use || to concatenate 
put string literals in single quotes
table in oracle called "dual"  that has a varchar2(1) of dummy
count(*) gets the count of rows
upper() and lower() functions for helping to compare while ignoring case

like 'S%' - compare to pattern (starts with S)
	% means anything or nothing
	_ means exactly one of any character
	Examples:
		'_o%'  o is in the second position
		'___' is exactly three characers long
				
Don't need tick marks for number data type
	avoid implicit conversion
	
Not equals
	!=
	<>
