Domain Name System (DNS)  Notes

DNS - like a phonebook that translates names into IP Addresses
IP Address - a number that corresponds to a device on the network
Network - either a local network or the internet

TLD - top level domain (.com)
domain (website name)
subdomain (www)

LDH Rule - letters, digits, hyphen

Time to Live - a mechanism that limits the lifespan of lifetime of data in a computer network
	high - info doesn't need to be queried as much, better for production
	low - better for development and switching servers
Propagation - the process of the changes being picked up across the internet

Name Servers
	master - stores original copies of records
	slave - gets copies of data to share the load and improve availability. 
	answer questions to your DNS queries
	computer gets quickest name server to respond
	
Root Servers
	13 total located throughout the world
	Hold the root zone file which is the authoritative list of DNS servers for all TLDs
	Without them there would be no internet
	
Records
	A Record - most common record returned from name servers. Maps host names to IP Addresses
	* wild card record
	MX Record 
		specify how mail should be routed via SMTP
		specified by fully qualified domain name
		specified by priority
		backups hold mail in queue in case the priority server is not available
	CNAME Record
		canonical name record
		used for aliases when creating domain names
		makes maintenance easier if locations change
	Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN)
		www.example.com
	TXT Records
		text record
		can be used to verify domain ownership
		SPF Records help to reduce SPAM
			sender policy framework
		DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
			method for associating a domain name with an email message thereby allowing a person, role, or organization to claim some responsibility for the message
	Reverse DNS
		PTR records used to check if server name is associated with IP Address where connection was initiated from
		Useful for Forward-confirmed reverse dns, which will ensure that both the PTR and A records match
	SOA Record
		start of authority
		first entry in DNS Zone File
		update time, when to check, who manages it, retry time, expire time, etc.
		handled by name server usually
