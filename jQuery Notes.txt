jQuery Notes

JavaScript library
api.jquery.com
.ajax used heavily in DataTrak
Made it easy to cleanly separate JavaScript from mark up in a cross browser compatible way
Can chain methods together
$(".warning").hide().show("slow")
Include in a project:
	1) can include at bottom of body (best practice, better experience for the user, don't need .ready())
	2) can put script tag in <head>
	paste in from website using jQuery with a CDN
