JSP Notes

Are turned into servlets by container (JBoss)
Once you have deployed a JSP, it only has to be translated and compiled once. After that it is like any other servlet.
Expression Language (EL) is the new best practice. Unfortunately older applications must still be maintained.
	syntax: ${application.mail}
		same as <%= application.getAttribute("mail") %>

Scriplet
	<% Java Code %>
Expression
	<%= Argument sent to println() %>
	Don't use semi-colons in expressions
Directive
	<%@ page import="java.util.*" %>
		import is just an attribute
		defines page specific properties
	<%@ taglib tagdir="blah" %>
		custom tags
	<%@ include file="blah.html" %>
		defines text and code that gets added into the current page at translation time
		lets you build reusable chunks that can be added to each page without having to duplicate all the code in each JSP (like a navigation bar)
Declaration
	<%! Code added to the servlet class outside of the service method (member variables/methods) %>
Comment
	<%-- Comment goes here --%>
	Unlike HTML comments, these will be stripped out of the translated page. Both can be used in JSPs.
	

Custom tags
	JSTL - Java Standard Tag Library
	can be used instead of having scriplets all over the place
	For loop to make a table of movies
		<table>
			<c:forEach var="movie" items="${movieList}" >
				<tr>
					<td>${movie}</td>
				</tr>
			</c:forEach>
		</table>
	<jsp:include page="inputComments.jsp" />
		can conditionally include certain things on the page
		one example would be only allowing members to post comments 
	<c:choose>, <c:when>, <c:otherwise
		like an if else
